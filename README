This is an implementation for VLG Project 1 using igraph C.

This project's goal is to compute approximations for the diameter, radius,
center and diametral vertices of a very large sparse graph.

Usage:
  make
  ./vlg STRATEGY GRAPH_FILE
    where STRATEGY is one of these: classic, center_chain, balanced

If you don't want to display the full logs:
  make opti
  ./vlg STRATEGY GRAPH_FILE

Or you can also do (to not display the logs):
  make
  ./vlg STRATEGY GRAPH_FILE 2> /dev/null
